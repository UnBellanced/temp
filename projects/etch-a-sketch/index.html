        The css would be manipulated in such a way so that the rgb color for the grid is randomly set
        on the first pass, but the random numbers for the color should give a light color
        and then each other pass would .darker() the rgb color by 10%. This would be done by checking if
        there is already a color there or not to keep the color and only darken it.
    
        Be careful with borders and margins.
    
        Add a button that would allow the user to specify the value for the number of squares per side
        of the grid. This would remove the grid that's currently there by un-appending the sub-flex boxes
        and then creating the new grid using the same function that created the previous grid except with the
        given dimensions instead of the deafult 16 and a max of 100 for the input.
        The button would call on a prompt tag which would in turn take the input and give it to us.
    
        you might need to use 'this' keyword to manipulate the elemenet that the event is 'working on currently'
